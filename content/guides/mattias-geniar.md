Mattias is well known for his open source contributions and expertise in web development
 and systems management.

Mattias' tutorial does the following:

 - installs the SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter plugin
 - generates an export of posts, pages and uploads assets
 - modifies the exporter to include custom post types from WP
 - creates new Hugo site
 - imports the WP site data into Hugo
 - installs a default Hugo theme

So, it's a pretty good simple guide. It doesn't go into how to migrate your
 theme from WP to Hugo or handle things like search or contact forms, so you'll
 need to browse other [guides](/guides) for that.
