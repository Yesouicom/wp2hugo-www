[Guides](/guides) and [Tool](/tools) for migrating WordPress sites to Hugo.

## What's the typical workflow to migrate a WP site to Hugo?

 - planning what to migrate from the source site (content, theme, dynamic functionality)
 - exporting the content from WordPress
 - creating a new Hugo site
 - preparing the data for import
 - importing the site content into Hugo
 - adjusting your thematic layout
 - adding any missing functionality (shopping cart, contact forms, search)

### Why Hugo?

Hugo is *the fastest* static site generator, with a really solid, simple way to develop websites.
 Unlike WordPress, there's no database or security
 issues to worry about. It's very developer-friendly, but anyone wanting a fast, secure website
 can learn how to use it with a little effort. It has a great community behind it and is frequently
 being improved. You can run Hugo on any old computer you have available and publish your site to
 globally fast CDNs. No need to pay for hosting!
